# odin-recipes
This project will seek to create a basic recipe website with pages linking to a number of recipes. The aim of the project is for me to get comfortable with creating repositories via GitHub.com, as well as the basic approach to coding and proper coding practices.

The project contains three recipes for baked goods with headings, images, numbered and unnumbered lists, as well as a line of recipe credit and a single hyperlink to test security attributes.

While I still have a long way to go, working on this project did help me gain a more comprehensive understanding of what the different HTML attributes do, while also allowing me to get more comfortable working both in VScode and command line.
