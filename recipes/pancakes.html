    <h3>Need a reason to wake up in the morning?</h3>
    <p>Pancakes are surely the answer and with this recipe in your arsenal, you'll never want to sleep in again!</p>

    <h4>Overview of Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100g of plain flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>300 ml of semi-skimmed milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of vegetable or sunflower oil, with extra for frying</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 100g of plain flour and 1 pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and crack 2 eggs into the middle.</li>
        <li>Pour in 50ml of semi-skimmed milk and 1 tbsp oil.</li>
        <li>Whisk from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk, and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.</li>
        <li>Add a generous splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter with a consistency of slightly thick single cream.</li>
        <li>Heat your pan, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture for a thin and even layer.</li>
        <li>Leave to cook, undisturbed, for approx. 30 seconds. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after 30 seconds and will be ready to turn.</li>
        <li>Ease a palette knife under the pancake and flip it over. Cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Continue with the rest of the better, serving them as you cook.</li>
        <li>Add your favourite toppings, sweet or savoury, for the ultimate pancake experience.</li>
    </ol>
